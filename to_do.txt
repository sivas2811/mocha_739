======Tasks====

1. Consistent Hashing - Done
2. EC2- Get Server machines
3. Jpype to Consistent Hashing
 The task is .. given a of topic from the  UI find the server which contains the data (using consistent hashing). Now consistent hashing is coded in Java. We need to use JPype for interfacing..
4. Backend java processes to control replication - We cant replicate to all the "3" server instantly. We proposed eventual consistency. So there has to be a background process (a separate Java program) to handle this. For this.. take 2-3 machines in EC2.. setup databases.,. and add data in one.. try replicating in others (incrementally)..
